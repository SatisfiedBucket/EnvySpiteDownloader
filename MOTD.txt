GET THAT ROD OF HARMONY OUTTA HERE! I DON'T EVER WANNA SEE THAT EVER AGAIN! I MEAN, WHAT WAS RE-LOGIC THINKING, A ROD OF DISCORD WITH NO COOLDOWN? SERIOUSLY! POST-MOONLORD MODDING IS RUINED! COME ON MAN, I WANTED TO CREATE A UNIVERSE THAT IS FAIR AND SQUARE, BUT THE ROD OF HARMONY RUINS EVERYTHING! SO NO, I'M NOT LETTING YOU USE IT. YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD TROLL ME, BUT IT TURNS OUT YOU'RE THE ONE GETTING TROLLED! AND YOU KNOW THAT.  HELL, YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW THAT ANYWAYS. YOU PROBABLY LOOKED UP THE FIGHT ON THE INTERNET. YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT I'M DOING THIS. I MEAN, I CAN'T SEE WHY YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT IT, I ALREADY SMASHED THE RAGE AND ADRENALINE, OF COURSE I'M GONNA SMASH THE ROD OF HARMONY. BUT NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO SMASH YOU. OOOH, THAT CAME OUT WRONG... BASICALLY, WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS, I DON'T LIKE CHEATERS, AND IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE. YOU PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE NEVER BROUGHT THAT DAMN ITEM IN HERE
