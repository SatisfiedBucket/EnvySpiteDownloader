I have decided to leave Envy for a week and possibly discontinue EnvyDL forever in the process. This choice was made due to multiple reasons but mostly due to doomah telling me to kill myself, satire or not that is fucking disgusting. So if I don't rejoin Envy this is goodbye. You can still contact me on youtube and discord under the name @thebluenebula but until then. See you later. Or never.",
